#Examples

##Register a new user

First, what you have to check is that the user does not already exist. For that purpose, you have to call the **/is_user** request.

For example, if in your app you have an user with the identificator = 0014823, you should do:

```shell
curl -H 'Username: 98765' \
  -H 'Apikey: .....' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  "https://api.woowup.com/apiv2/98765/is_user?service=1&service_uid=0014823"
```

| Parameter   | Description               |
| ----------- | ------------------------- |
| service_uid | Identificator in your app |

It will return a JSON object, with 2 fields: **status** and **message**

```json
{
  "status":true,
  "message":"User already exists"
}
```

**status = true** means the user __already exists__
**status = false** means the user __does not exist__


Then, in case you got the user does not exist, you have to do a POST request to register that new user

```shell
curl -H 'Username: 98765' \
  -H 'Apikey: .....' \
  -d 'uid=0014823&pass=1234&email=johndoe@gmail.com&first_name=john&last_name=doe' \
  https://api.woowup.com/apiv2/98765/register_user_classic
```

The POST method to use is **/register_user_classic**

| Parameter | Description               |
| --------- | ------------------------- |
| uid       | Identificator in your app |
| pass      | Password (*)              |
| email     | User's Email              |
| first_name| User's First name         |
| last_name | User's Last name          |

(*) It is required for you to set one field as _password_ in your Custom Form

It returns a JSON object with 2 fields: **status**, **data**

**status** means if the user could be registered **successfully**
**data** is the user object as it was created in WoowUp

```json
{
  "status":true,
  "data":{
    "user":{
      "service":1,
      "status":1,
      "service_uid":"0014823",
      "service_pass":"81dc9bdb52d04dc20036dbd8313ed055", //encoded password
      "email":"johndoe@gmail.com",
      "first_name":"John",
      "last_name":"Doe",
      "name":"John Doe",
      "createtime":"2015-05-14 11:33:12",
      "id":"99339",
      "locale":null,
      "timezone":null,
      "fid":null,
      "useremail":null,
      "gender":null,
      "birthday":null,
      "hometown":null,
      "location":null,
      "country_id":null
    }
  }
}
```
##Saving asociated registration form
Next step, you'll need to complete the registration form defined in your administration console and asociate it to the newly registered user. Use the userapp_id returned by register_user_classic:

```shell
curl -H 'Username: 98765' \
  -H 'Apikey: .....' \
  -d 'email=johndoe@gmail.com' \
  https://api.woowup.com/apiv2/98765/save_cf/?userapp_id=1234521
```
The response will be:
```json
{
  "status":true,
  "message":"Se guardo la respuesta con exito"
}
```

##Getting user information

If you want to have more information about your user before adding him points, you can use the GET request **/user_by_uid** or **/user_by_email**

```shell
curl -H 'Username: 98765' \
  -H 'Apikey: .....' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  https://api.woowup.com/apiv2/98765/user_by_uid?uid=0014823
```

| Parameter   | Description               |
| ----------- | ------------------------- |
| uid         | Identificator in your app |

Or:

```shell
curl -H 'Username: 98765' \
  -H 'Apikey: .....' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  https://api.woowup.com/apiv2/98765/user_by_email?email=johndoe@gmail.com
```

| Parameter   | Description               |
| ----------- | ------------------------- |
| email       | User's Email              |

The response might be something like this

  "data":{
    "user":{
      "points":"4250",
      "name":"John Doe",
